## Overview

This tool predicts whether a given protein sequence is a DNA-binding protein (DBP) using features extracted by the ProtT5 model. It takes a FASTA file as input, processes each sequence, and outputs a CSV file with probabilities and binary predictions (DNA Binding or Non-DNA Binding).

## Features

- **ProtT5** for protein feature extraction.
- **Pre-trained pLM-DBPs** model for DNA-binding protein prediction.
- Command-line interface for easy use.
- Takes a FASTA file as input and outputs a CSV file with predictions.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- transformers
- Biopython
- pandas

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suresh-pokharel/pLM-DBPs.git
